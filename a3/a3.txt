= A description of extra features or design aspects that you are particularly proud of
* Successfully add HSTS headers to all responses! :)
* Tried XSS attack on user signup with username <script> alert(1); </script> and successfully escaped it!
* Setting session timeout to a very short time can trigger the Invalid CSRF token error.

Thank you!
